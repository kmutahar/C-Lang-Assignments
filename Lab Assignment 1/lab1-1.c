  Paper of size A0 has dimensions 1189 mm x 841 mm.
  Each subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to its shorter sides.
  Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841 mm x 594 mm.
  Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes A0, A1, A2, â€¦ A8.

        t = h;
        h = w;
        w = t / 2;

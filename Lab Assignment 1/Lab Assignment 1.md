# Lab Assignment 1

1. Paper of size A0 has dimensions 1189 mm x 841 mm. Each subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to its shorter sides. Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841 mm x 594 mm. Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes A0, A1, A2, … A8.


2. Write a program to receive Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar co-ordinates (r, ø). Hint: r = sqrt ( x2 + y2 ) and ø= tan-1 ( y / x )  *(include the math.h header file)*


3. Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.


4. If value of an angle is input through the keyboard, write a program to print all its Trigonometric ratios.  *(include the math.h header file)*


5. If cost price and selling price of an item are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.
